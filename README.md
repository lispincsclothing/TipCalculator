# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Romeo Blue**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- For required user story, cutting and pasting buttons resulted in unexpected behavior (copied over linkage to outlets as well)
- For settings page user story, had to put calculate tip and total in seperate function that was called in both viewWillApper and IBAction calculate tip - otherwise the tip would not be recalculated when return from settings page.
